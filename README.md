# Read Me -- Supply Chain Application

## Overview

The Supply Chain application demonstrates a generic example between a Buyer, Seller, Supplier, two Warehouses, and two independent Transport Companies. The process includes: 
* Creating a quote request from Buyer to Seller for a given product
* Supplier collecting quotes for product and transportation from the Warehouses and Transport Companies
* Aggregating delivery details with price, adding margin, and sending a quote to Buyer
* Upon acceptance by Buyer of the quote, order creation and initiation of goods delivery from the Warehouses
* Upon delivery of goods, payment from Buyer to Seller, either in full or partially, and creation of a payment obligation through the supply chain

## Getting Started

### Installing

#### Prerequisites
Be sure you have the following installed:
* DAML SDK 0.12.21
* Docker
* Java
* Maven

#### Build with Maven

Type:
```
mvn clean package
```
_**Note:** If you change the DAML models locally, you need to run re-run this command before starting the application._

### Starting the App

Running on local machine requires three terminal tabs:
1. Run Sandbox and Navigator:
```bash
daml start
```

2. Run bots:
```bash
java -jar target/supplychain-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -p 7600
```
You can now  navigate to the URL: localhost:7500 with a browser to interact with the application.

**Important:** "localhost" on which the application is run should not have a web-facing IP address assigned to it.

### Running with Docker-compose
_**Note:** This works on Linux, but, on MacOS, the Docker configuration needs to be changed to use at least 6 CPUs, due to a bug in the platform._

After a Maven build, you can start with
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

and stop with
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Resetting the Prototype

Reset the application by following these steps:

1. Stop the App by following the steps above.

2. Start the App in Docker or Standalone mode by following the steps in the relevant section.

3. Stop the running application on each of the terminal tabs (using **CTRL+C**) and start again.

## This Guide
This User Guide will take you step-by-step through the whole supply chain process described in the Overview.

_**Note:** This demo is designed to show successful conclusion of the supply chain workflow without exceptions or error conditions. A full production implementation would include additional features, handle errors and exceptions, and incorporate appropriate security controls._

## Workflow

**Roles and Responsibilities**

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Role</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Responsibilities</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Buyer
   </td>
   <td>Buyer places a request for price and delivery for a quantity of goods with Seller. Once trade details are received from Seller, Buyer can review and accept trade details. After confirmation of trade details, the delivery process can begin. Buyer is responsible for making full or partial payments upon delivery of goods.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Seller
   </td>
   <td>Seller receives an order for goods. Seller is responsible for providing the price and delivery date confirmation to Buyer. Once the order is finalized, Seller is responsible for delivering the goods. Seller is in relationships with  Supplier. Seller does not need to know the full details on inventories or how orders are allocated.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Supplier
   </td>
   <td>In the example, we model Supplier as a logistics provider with established contractual relationship with warehouse owners and transport companies. It is responsible for allocating orders to warehouses and finding transport companies for delivery. Suppliers need to be notified of issues during order fulfillment and transportation. Warehouses are directly owned by Supplier.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Warehouse
   </td>
   <td>Warehouse keeps records of inventory and is responsible for fulfilling orders. In our simplified workflow, once goods are handed off to Transport Companies, its responsibilities are complete.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Transport Company
   </td>
   <td>Transport Company is in possession of goods during transportation. It notifies relevant participants of any changes in the status of the delivery. 
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Steps**

The Supply Chain application includes the following steps:

1. **Market Setup:** The application starts with an automated market setup process. Participants and their roles are created, and relationships are set up.

2. **Quote Request:** Buyer requests a trade quote from Seller for the price and delivery date for a quantity of goods. Seller reviews the quote request and starts the pricing and delivery collection process. 

    Supplier receives notification of the new trade quote request from Seller.

3. **Inventory Management:** Supplier starts the quote collection process by selecting Warehouses to fulfill the product order request. At the same time, Supplier also sends a quote request for delivery from Transport Company 1 and 2. Transport Companies give a quote for price and estimated time of arrival for the delivery.

4. **Delivery Management:** Supplier uses an automated algorithm optimized for best price to calculate and finalize delivery. The algorithm computes quantities to be delivered from the Warehouses and calculates the amount of goods Transport Company needs to deliver from the Warehouses.

5. **Order Finalization:** Supplier sends an aggregated quote to Seller. Seller can review the quote details (quantity of goods, place of shipment, transport company, price) and can add margin to the price. Seller then sends the quote to Buyer. Buyer can review the quote and approve the order. Once the order is finalized, delivery of goods can start.

6. **Transport:** Transport companies pick up product from Warehouses. Pickup of goods is affirmed by the Warehouse. Transport companies then deliver goods to Buyer.

7. **Delivery and Payment:** Buyer needs to acknowledge the delivery. When a successful delivery is acknowledged by Buyer, an automated payment obligation is created between Buyer and Seller for the amount of goods delivered. If goods are arriving separately, then partial delivery and partial payment occurs. Consecutive payment obligations can also be initiated between Seller, Supplier, Warehouses, and Transport Companies.
