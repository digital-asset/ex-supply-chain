# Reference Application: Supply Chain Application

## Overview

The Supply Chain application demonstrates a generic example between a Buyer, Seller, Supplier, two Warehouses, and two independent Transport Companies. The process includes:
* Creating a quote request from Buyer to Seller for a given product
* Supplier collecting quotes for product and transportation from the Warehouses and Transport Companies
* Aggregating delivery details with price, adding margin, and sending a quote to Buyer
* Upon acceptance by Buyer of the quote, order creation and initiation of goods delivery from the Warehouses
* Upon delivery of goods, payment from Buyer to Seller, either in full or partially, and creation of a payment obligation through the supply chain

## Getting Started

### Installing

**Disclaimer:** This reference application is intended to demonstrate the capabilities of the DAML. You are recommended to consider other non-functional aspects, like security, resiliency, recoverability, etc prior to production use.

#### Prerequisites

Be sure you have the following installed.

  - [DAML SDK](https://docs.daml.com/)
  - Java
  - Yarn
  - Node v12
  - Make

### Starting the App

1. Build the App. Type:
    ```shell
    make build
    ```
    **Note:** If you change the DAML models locally, you need to re-run this command before starting the application.
2. Start the DAML Sandbox and Navigator. Type:
    ```shell
    daml start --sandbox-option --address=localhost
    ```
    The navigator will automatically open in new browser tab at http://localhost:7500.
3. Once the sandbox has started, start the automation logic by starting triggers. Type:
    ```shell
    scripts/startTriggers.sh localhost 6865 target/triggers.dar
    ```
4. Once the sandbox has started, start the automation logic by starting triggers. Type:
    ```shell
    cd ui
    yarn start
    ```

### Stopping the App

1. Stop the triggers by pressing **Ctrl+C**.
1. Stop the Sandbox and the Navigator by pressing **Ctrl+C** in the DAML assistant.

### Resetting the Prototype

Reset the application by following these steps:
1.  Stop the app by following the steps in [Stopping the App](#stopping-the-app) section.
2.  Start the app by following the steps in [Starting the App](#starting-the-app) section.

## Working with DAML Hub

1. As a first step, build the whole project:
```
make clean build
```

2. Start a new project at DAML Hub. Upload the DARs to DAML Hub (in your new project, Deployments tab / Upload file, two files `target/*.dar`), deploy the model (supplychain.dar, Deploy Instance).

3. Add the parties to the DAML Hub project: Buyer, Seller, Supplier, Warehouse1, Warehouse2, TransportCompany1, TransportCompany2.
    - Download `participants.json` (Ledger settings tab).
    - Download `parties.json` (Users tab).

4. Run the market setup:
```
daml script \
  --participant-config participants.json \
  --json-api \
  --dar target/supplychain.dar \
  --script-name DA.RefApps.SupplyChain.LedgerSetupScript:setupMarketWithDablParties \
  --input-file parties.json
```

5. Run the triggers from the DAML Hub UI:
```
Seller
DA.RefApps.SupplyChain.Triggers.AggregatedQuoteTrigger:trigger
DA.RefApps.SupplyChain.Triggers.DeliveryCompleteTrigger:trigger

Warehouse1
DA.RefApps.SupplyChain.Triggers.InventoryQuoteRequestTrigger:trigger

Warehouse2
DA.RefApps.SupplyChain.Triggers.InventoryQuoteRequestTrigger:trigger

Supplier
DA.RefApps.SupplyChain.Triggers.CalculateAggregatedQuoteTrigger:trigger
```

6. Run `make installui`. Then run in the `ui` folder (modify the URL, use yours):
```
export REACT_APP_HTTP_BASE_URL=https://isfesq2lvxg1y2v8.projectdabl.com
export REACT_APP_WS_BASE_URL=wss://isfesq2lvxg1y2v8.projectdabl.com
yarn build
```
Then run `zip -r supplychain.zip build/`. Upload `supplychain.zip` to DAML Hub and deploy the UI. Follow "View site". Upload `parties.json` to the UI using the button on the login screen (Upload parties.json (tokens)). Receiving no error means you have succeeded.

Note: parties.json needs to be re-uploaded to the UI every time the tokens change.

## User Guide
This User Guide will take you step-by-step through the whole supply chain process described in the Overview.

_**Note:** This demo is designed to show successful conclusion of the supply chain workflow without exceptions or error conditions. A full production implementation would include additional features, handle errors and exceptions, and incorporate appropriate security controls._

## Workflow

**Roles and Responsibilities**

<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Role</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Responsibility</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Buyer
   </td>
   <td>Buyer places a request for price and delivery for a quantity of goods with Seller. Once trade details are received from Seller, Buyer can review and accept trade details. After confirmation of trade details, the delivery process can begin. Buyer is responsible for making full or partial payments upon delivery of goods.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Seller
   </td>
   <td>Seller receives an order for goods. Seller is responsible for providing the price and delivery date confirmation to Buyer. Once the order is finalized, Seller is responsible for delivering the goods. Seller is in relationships with  Supplier. Seller does not need to know the full details on inventories or how orders are allocated.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Supplier
   </td>
   <td>In the example, we model Supplier as a logistics provider with established contractual relationship with warehouse owners and transport companies. It is responsible for allocating orders to warehouses and finding transport companies for delivery. Suppliers need to be notified of issues during order fulfillment and transportation. Warehouses are directly owned by Supplier.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Warehouse
   </td>
   <td>Warehouse keeps records of inventory and is responsible for fulfilling orders. In our simplified workflow, once goods are handed off to Transport Companies, its responsibilities are complete.
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Transport Company
   </td>
   <td>Transport Company is in possession of goods during transportation. It notifies relevant participants of any changes in the status of the delivery.
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**Steps**

The Supply Chain application includes the following steps:

1. **Market Setup:** The application starts with an automated market setup process. Participants and their roles are created, and relationships are set up.

2. **Quote Request:** Buyer requests a trade quote from Seller for the price and delivery date for a quantity of goods. Seller reviews the quote request and starts the pricing and delivery collection process.

    Supplier receives notification of the new trade quote request from Seller.

3. **Inventory Management:** Supplier starts the quote collection process by selecting Warehouses to fulfill the product order request. At the same time, Supplier also sends a quote request for delivery from Transport Company 1 and 2. Transport Companies give a quote for price and estimated time of arrival for the delivery.

4. **Delivery Management:** Supplier uses an automated algorithm optimized for best price to calculate and finalize delivery. The algorithm computes quantities to be delivered from the Warehouses and calculates the amount of goods Transport Company needs to deliver from the Warehouses.

5. **Order Finalization:** Supplier sends an aggregated quote to Seller. Seller can review the quote details (quantity of goods, place of shipment, transport company, price) and can add margin to the price. Seller then sends the quote to Buyer. Buyer can review the quote and approve the order. Once the order is finalized, delivery of goods can start.

6. **Transport:** Transport companies pick up product from Warehouses. Pickup of goods is affirmed by the Warehouse. Transport companies then deliver goods to Buyer.

7. **Delivery and Payment:** Buyer needs to acknowledge the delivery. When a successful delivery is acknowledged by Buyer, an automated payment obligation is created between Buyer and Seller for the amount of goods delivered. If goods are arriving separately, then partial delivery and partial payment occurs. Consecutive payment obligations can also be initiated between Seller, Supplier, Warehouses, and Transport Companies.
